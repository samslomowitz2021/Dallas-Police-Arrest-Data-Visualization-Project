## Race and Police Arrests: What We Can and Cannot Learn from Arrest Data

### Introduction
---
Racial bias exists in use-of-force arrests and white police officers with less experience have a higher arrest rate (Weisburst, 2022). Specifically, Black civilians are more likely to be arrested by White officers (Wright and Headley, 2020). Our dataset, from Kaggle.com, contains Dallas Police Arrest data from 2014 to 2022 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aaronnichowilliams/dallas-police-activity). We sought to determine which years had the most years had the most arrests and which ages had the most prevalence in the arrest data. 

### Inspiration
---
We want to build a interactive dashboard using JavaScript libraries to visualize police arrest data in Dallas, TX. Our main filter will be racial categories. We would like to design an interactive map similar to the UK Police Tableau Public dashboard showing the location of the incidents colored by type of crime (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/laurentghesquiere/viz/UKPoliceData/UKPoliceIncidentsDashboard).

### Future Work
---
We would like to further explore the Dallas Police Department API to bring in real-time data and visualize crime, location, and arrest data in the DFW metroplex. Our main questions would be:

1.	Do drug-related arrests outnumber violent crimes? We would like to look at any overlap between these categories.
2.	What drug categories are abundant in the data?
3.	Is Dallas a safe/low-crime city?
4.	Which areas of Dallas are high in arrest count?
5.	What time of day and what day of the week do most arrest occur?
