## Race and Police Arrests: What We Can and Cannot Learn from Arrest Data

### Introduction
---
Racial bias exists in use-of-force arrests and white police officers with less experience have a higher arrest rate (Weisburst, 2022). Specifically, Black civilians are more likely to be arrested by White officers (Wright and Headley, 2020). Our dataset, from Kaggle.com, contains Dallas Police Arrest data from 2014 to 2022 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aaronnichowilliams/dallas-police-activity). We sought to determine which years had the most years had the most arrests and which ages had the most prevalence in the arrest data.
